# Moving from custom nvim config to distribution

For couple of years I've been using a custom nvim config, which mostly consisted of 
copy-pasted code from here and there. As I opted for Neovim, which is still in development
and has yet to reach v1.0.0, maintaining own setting becomes somewhat taxing. Therefore I
made a choice to move to community maintained distribution of Neovim configuration.

I found NVchad appealing to an eye and holding most functionality I need, with not much
configuration needed from my side. Nevertheless, I had to swap keys and add few loc, which
is why I am putting it up on GH.
